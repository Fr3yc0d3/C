### Conditionals 

```

Conditionals are used to perform Different Computations or actions Depending on whether a condition evalutes to true or false

```

Here i am using simply if statement 
e.g same as if i have a gf ? then what was my life something like this 
and it's only exicutes if the statement is **TRUE** and that's the only reason we also called this _Decision Structure_

it looks like something 

```

if (expression)
    statement
    
```

so important thig here to see is that the expression evaluates T or F and statement will be come under braces --> {} <-- this thing 

Now let's Code and make use of if statement
